# Node.js CPU Core Performance Comparison
This repository provides a sample program to demonstrate the execution time required for Node.js under different CPU core limitations.
The results show that execution on a single core is approximately twice as slow as on multiple cores, while there is no significant difference in performance among multiple cores.
